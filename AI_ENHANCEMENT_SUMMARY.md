   - OpenRouter API integration with Gemini model
   - Resume parsing with structured data extraction
   - Email analysis for job relevance detection
   - Skill gap analysis with recommendations
   - Fallback mechanisms for robustness

2. **AI Controllers** (`server/controllers/ai.controller.js`)
   - `/analyze-resume` - AI-powered resume parsing
   - `/analyze-email` - Smart email analysis
   - `/smart-suggestions` - Resume-email comparison
   - `/batch-analyze` - Bulk email processing

3. **API Routes** (`server/routes/aiRoutes.js`)
   - RESTful endpoints for all AI features
   - Integrated with main Express application
   - Error handling and logging

4. **Package Dependencies**
   - Added OpenRouter API support
   - Environment configuration for API keys
   - Enhanced existing package.json

### Frontend Enhancements

   - Frontend service for AI API communication
   - Consistent error handling
   - Promise-based async operations

2. **Enhanced ResumeUpload Component**
   - AI status indicators during processing
   - Backward compatibility with existing functionality
   - Enhanced data extraction with both basic and AI modes
   - Visual feedback for AI processing states

3. **New AISuggestionPanel Component**
   - Real-time AI analysis of selected emails
   - Visual match percentage indicators
   - Skill matching with color-coded tags
   - AI-generated recommendations
   - Professional styling with responsive design

4. **Updated Dashboard Integration**
   - Smart switching between basic and AI-powered suggestions
   - Batch analysis functionality for processing multiple emails
   - Enhanced state management for AI features

- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable

## üé® User Experience Improvements

### Visual Enhancements
- AI status indicators with loading animations
- Color-coded skill matching (green = matched, red = missing)
- Progress bars for relevance scoring
- Professional gradient styling
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

### Functional Improvements
- One-click batch analysis of inbox
- Real-time feedback during AI processing
- Intelligent email prioritization
- Actionable recommendations for skill development
- Seamless fallback to basic functionality

## üîê Configuration

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
# Server (.env)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_oauth_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_oauth_client_secret
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
```

### API Integration
- OpenRouter API for Gemini model access
- Fallback parsing for offline/error scenarios
- Rate limiting and error handling built-in

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. Node.js and npm installed
2. MongoDB database connection
3. Google OAuth credentials
4. OpenRouter API key

### Running the Application
```bash
# Start backend server
cd server
npm install
npm start  # Runs on port 3500

# Start frontend client
cd client
npm install
npm start  # Runs on port 3000
```

### Testing AI Features
1. Upload a resume to enable AI analysis
2. Select emails to see AI-powered suggestions
3. Use batch analysis for processing multiple emails
4. Review skill matching and recommendations
