# 🔧 Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved

### ❌ **Problem 1: "onSkillsExtracted is not a function"**
**Root Cause**: The Dashboard component was passing `onResumeDataExtracted` prop to ResumeUpload, but the ResumeUpload component was trying to call `onSkillsExtracted`.

**Solution Applied**:
1. **Enhanced prop handling**: ResumeUpload now accepts both `onSkillsExtracted` and `onResumeDataExtracted` props
2. **Smart callback logic**: Prioritizes the new `onResumeDataExtracted` callback when available, falls back to legacy `onSkillsExtracted`
3. **Backward compatibility**: Maintains support for both old and new prop names

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Added smart callback detection
const callbackFunction = onResumeDataExtracted || onSkillsExtracted;

// Enhanced callback handling with proper fallbacks
if (onResumeDataExtracted) {
  // New enhanced callback with AI data
  onResumeDataExtracted(skills, aiData);
} else if (onSkillsExtracted) {
  // Legacy callback for basic skills only
  onSkillsExtracted(skills);
}
```

### ✅ **Problem 2: OpenRouter API Integration**
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - OpenRouter API key successfully added to `.env` file

**Configuration**:
```
